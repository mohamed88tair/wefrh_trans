```

### Infrastructure Layer (Advanced Patterns)
```typescript
// server/infrastructure/enterprise-repository.ts
- Professional caching with LRU eviction
- Query builder with flexible filtering
- Performance monitoring with metrics
- Memory management with cleanup
```

### Application Layer (Service Orchestration)
```typescript
// server/application/enterprise-application.ts
- Dependency injection container
